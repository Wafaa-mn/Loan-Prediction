Loan Prediction Model
This project is part of a course I completed on Analytics Vidhya, where I learned how to predict loan approvals using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains customer details, and the goal is to predict whether a loan application will be approved (Y) or not (N).

Current Progress:
1.Achieved 80% accuracy using models like:
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Tree
    Random Forest
    XGBoost
2.Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation was used for better performance evaluation.


How to Run the Project:
1.Clone this repository.
2.Make sure the following .csv files are available:
    cleaned_train_data.csv â€“ The cleaned training dataset.
    cleaned_test_data.csv â€“ The cleaned test dataset.
    testdata.csv â€“ The original test data for generating predictions.
    sample_submission.csv â€“ The sample submission template.
3.Run the Modeling.py script to train models and generate predictions.
4.Check the final_predictions.csv file for predicted results.


Notes
The project is a work in progress, and Iâ€™ll push updates as I improve the accuracy.
Suggestions and contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request. ðŸ˜Š
